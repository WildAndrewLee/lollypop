Lollypop is about albums, designed for album playback.
Playlists are presents for later usage (phone sync, specific party, ...)
If you really need a player designed around playlists, Lollypop is a bad choice ;)

WONTFIX:
- Showing bitrate
- Cloud playback

-Lollypop version:
-Gtk Version:
-Linux distribution:
